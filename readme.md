## CSGO Case Data Analysis (Currently without knives/gloves)

Works out average profit per case (Currently only uses gun skin prices), the code only currently works for USD and GBP but is easily changed (So without changes the code will crash unless you live in UK or USA).
The code takes a while to run as Steam has a limit on requests so it compiles data from CSGOStash as well as SteamMarket, but only uses steam market prices.
The code should have no need to be changed when a new case gets released, unless they do something odd.

## Instructions

- Install python 3
- Install requests module - `pip install requests`
- It can take about 15 mins to compile all the data it needs
- Run main.py
- Currently the Program outputs the result in the terminal.

## Help

	If you have issues, 
	Message on the github page
	
	But the code should work fine
